Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Enhanced Reading Practice Platform
ðŸ“„ Document History
Version 1.0: Initial draft, September 9, 2025

1. Product Overview
Vision
A comprehensive educational platform that leverages pre-generated TTS audio and unlimited student recording submissions to provide schools with a cost-effective, privacy-focused reading assessment solution that gives teachers complete control.

Mission
To enable schools and districts to scale reading fluency assessment across all students by providing an easy-to-use, data-driven platform that eliminates the high, recurring costs of third-party APIs.

Current State Analysis
Many existing reading platforms rely on per-use APIs for text-to-speech (TTS) and voice analysis, which leads to unpredictable and often prohibitive costs for schools, especially at scale. This reliance also introduces data privacy concerns as student voice data is sent to external services. Our platform addresses these core pain points by shifting these processes to a scalable, one-time setup model.

Target Users
Teachers: The primary users. They manage content, create assignments, review submissions, and track student progress.

Students: The core consumers of the content. They listen to stories, record their readings, and submit them for review.

School Administrators: System managers and data overseers. They require a cost-effective, privacy-compliant, and easily maintainable system for their entire school or district.

User Personas
Elementary Teacher (Grade 1-3): "Ms. Davis" is overwhelmed with grading and wants a simple way to assign reading and check on her students' progress without spending hours listening to every single recording.

Reading Specialist: "Mr. Chen" needs detailed analytics and tools to identify students who are struggling with specific phonics or fluency issues so he can plan targeted interventions.

School IT Administrator: "Ms. Rodriguez" is concerned about student data privacy and needs a system that is easy to deploy, doesn't have variable costs, and is secure and reliable.

2. Product Goals & Business Rationale
Educational Goals
Improve Reading Fluency: Provide a consistent and accessible tool for students to practice reading.

4. User Experience (UX) Requirements
Student Experience
The student workflow must be as simple as possible to minimize friction, especially for younger learners.

User Story: "As a first-grade student, I want to easily find my assigned story and record my reading in just a few clicks so I can finish my homework without help."

Flow: Student logs in â†’ sees assigned stories â†’ clicks story â†’ listens to TTS audio â†’ records reading â†’ submits.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Simplicity: A maximum of 3 clicks from story selection to recording.

Accessibility: Support keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast visuals. Large, easy-to-press button targets.

Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback (e.g., a pulsing red button) during the recording process.

Teacher Experience
The teacher workflow should save time and provide valuable insights without being overly complex.

User Story: "As a teacher, I want to quickly review a student's reading submission, provide feedback, and track their progress over time to inform my lesson plans."

Daily Workflow: Check dashboard for new submissions â†’ review flagged recordings â†’ provide feedback â†’ track class progress.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Efficiency: Automated flagging and bulk actions should reduce review time by at least 50%.

Clarity: Data visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) must be intuitive and easy to interpret.

5. Technical Requirements
Architecture Overview
We will use a microservices-oriented architecture with a React-based frontend. This choice provides scalability and allows for independent development and deployment of different services. The key architectural decision is to use static file serving for audio to eliminate API costs and ensure fast loading.

Frontend: A React application to handle the user interface for both teachers and students.

Backend: A Python/Django backend to manage user authentication, API endpoints, and a PostgreSQL database for metadata.

Storage: We'll use a cloud-based object storage service (like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) to store both static TTS audio files and student recording files. This is highly scalable and cost-effective for large amounts of data.

API Endpoints
Student:

GET /api/student/assignments: Get a list of assigned stories.

POST /api/student/recordings: Upload a new student recording.

Teacher:

GET /api/teacher/classes: Get a teacher's classes and their status.
